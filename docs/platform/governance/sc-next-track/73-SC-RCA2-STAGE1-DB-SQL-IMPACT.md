# DB and SQL Impact

## Purpose

Confirm governance-only scope.

## Authoritative baseline

Work-start `b57c344c9b4e332966fe9f6d36a5da66a5faae71`; PR #29 merged; RCA-2 exact-final-head `511b19f80cdd42bb2fafde0563c7388b4f5b5f48`; evidence artifact `8621492010` with digest `sha256:9e95b85fff822cfae5aa6f7dbf25425d7c47551c32c18ac014aea4b90ee6a760`.

## Contract

```text
DB_CHANGE=NONE
SQL_ALLOCATION=NOT_REQUIRED
SQL_01_52=PROTECTED
SQL_53_PLUS=ABSENT
NEW_TABLE=NO
NEW_VIEW=NO
NEW_ROLE=NO
NEW_GRANT=NO
```

Any persistent database requirement blocks Stage 1 preparation and returns to System Coordination.

## Protection

Current traffic remains `0%`; feature flag remains `OFF`; production traffic is `0%`; primary authority remains current P1/P2; shadow serving and authority transfer are forbidden; DB/SQL changes are none.

## Verification

This document is governance evidence only. Actual traffic, endpoint, credential, allowlist, observation, production route/identity/traffic, candidate serving and authority transfer are `NOT_EXECUTED`.

## Handoff

Any implementation or Operations preparation requires a separate Draft change and explicit user approval.
